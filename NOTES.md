NOTES
=====
- separate execution threads for normal players and administrators (immorts)
- login/creation process is in separate execution thread
- TCP connection handling is in a separate execution thread
- design to allow multiple realms via a plugin topology, using a shared API with queues
- inter-realm banking will be possible via cryptocurrency blockchains with the banks acting as exchanges with open orders
- in-game mining for cryptocurrency should be an option for players somehow - need to invision a way to tie this in
- game operators should also mine for the currencies, and use some of the proceeds to offer interest on deposits (maybe use POS as well as POW?)
- no intentions to list the cryptocurrencies on external exchanges.  If this does happen, then the game operators should be sure to avoid being 51%-ed, maybe via an initial pre-mine?
- find low difficulty setup to allow for easy mining to start.
- may come up with a way to transfer items between realms in some limited fashion
- have rare items that give holder % PPS in the mining pools?

Realms
------
1. Settling the new world - pioneers
- using GIS maps to create world maps
- have in-town cyber-cafe-like place where pioneers can take time off to MUD in another realm - leads to time scale discrepencies?

2. Havokmud/Shadowdale type MUD (so DnD-like)

3. Space exploration (think Traveller RPG)

4. Pirate ships in the caribbean
